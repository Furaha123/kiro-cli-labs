### Sudoku Web Application
A simple, lightweight sudoku game that runs entirely in your browser.

### EC2 Instance Scheduler
Automates starting and stopping EC2 instances based on Bangkok business hours.

### Default Flow Log Analysis
Network flow log analysis and visualization tools.

### Terraform Infrastructure
Infrastructure as code examples using Terraform.

## How I Used Kiro CLI

### Initial Setup
```bash
kiro-cli chat
```

### Key Commands & Prompts Used

**1. Creating the Sudoku Game**
- Prompt: "create a sudoku game"
- Generated: `sudoku.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`

**2. EC2 Instance Scheduler**
- Prompt: "create a lambda function to start and stop ec2 instances based on bangkok business hours"
- Created automated scheduling solution

**3. Flow Log Analysis**
- Prompt: "analyze vpc flow logs and create visualization"
- Generated Python scripts for log analysis and network traffic visualization

**4. Terraform Infrastructure**
- Prompt: "create terraform configuration for s3 and cloudfront"
- Generated: Infrastructure as code with proper AWS resource definitions

**5. Git Operations**
- Prompt: "I want to push the workshop to my github but i faced the issue with rebase early this is the folder i want to use https://github.com/Furaha123/kiro-cli-labs"
- Kiro helped resolve rebase conflicts and push to GitHub

**6. Documentation**
- Prompt: "add in a readme of how i used kiro sofar like commands and prompts used"
- Generated this documentation

### Workflow Pattern
1. Start Kiro CLI session: `kiro-cli chat`
2. Describe what you want to build in natural language
3. Kiro generates the code and files
4. Iterate with follow-up prompts for refinements
5. Use Kiro for git operations and deployment

### Tips
- Be specific about requirements (e.g., timezone, business hours)
- Ask for explanations when needed
- Use Kiro for both code generation and DevOps tasks
- Kiro can help with git issues and repository management
